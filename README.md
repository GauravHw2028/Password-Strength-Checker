This is my first personal cyber security project. I have used basic java and a common password list i found on github
(https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/c9fbc4350b2e446d9ad16a9d5af94216a98adf40/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt)
you can use any other file too like rockyou etc.. , other than the common list , i have used a basic loop to check for basic password  requirements and used a strength point system to 
analyse and check the strength of the inputed password
